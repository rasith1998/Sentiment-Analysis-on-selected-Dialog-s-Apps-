# Sentiment-Analysis-on-selected-Dialog-s-Apps-
In this project, I am going to conduct a sentiment analysis on selected Dialog's Apps from Google Playstore 

Dialog Axiata PLC (formerly known as MTN Networks and later Dialog Telekom), is one of Sri Lanka's largest telecommunications service providers, and the country's largest mobile network operator with 17.1 million subscribers which amounts to 57% of the Sri Lankan mobile market. Dialog is a subsidiary of Axiata Group Berhad which owns 83.32% controlling stake of the company, while the rest is held by the public.[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialog_Axiata]

Dialog has been launching so many apps to their customers for an example MyDialog App · Dialog HomeTalk App · Athuru Mithuru App · Yeheli App · Mithra App · Smartlife App · Sri Lanka Pensions App · Nenasa App so on.
For my project purpose, I selecte some apps of Dailog that are MyDialog App, Dialog Retail Hub and Dialog HomeTalk App
